This incremental approach allows for strategic decomposition of the monolith rather than a risky complete rewrite. It helps understand dependencies, identify suitable candidates for extraction, and plan a phased modernization approach.

Data analytics helps organizations identify patterns, trends, and correlations that might not be immediately apparent, enabling better strategic planning and operational improvements. It complements rather than eliminates human judgment, aims to derive value from existing data (not just generate more), and informs but doesn't automatically implement process changes.",
